## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a data engineer with a growing interest in monitoring and logging for data pipelines, using the ELK stack to gain visibility into data workflows, troubleshoot issues, and ensure smooth operations. This repository is a collection of configuration files, test setups, and learning projects centered around building robust observability into data engineering environments.

As data pipelines grow in complexity, so does the need for reliable monitoring. Iâ€™m exploring how to use Elasticsearch for storing and indexing logs, Logstash for log ingestion and transformation, and Kibana for building dashboards and alerts that surface pipeline health and performance metrics.

This repository includes sample configurations for collecting logs from different stages of a pipelineâ€”such as ingestion, transformation, and loading. Iâ€™m also learning how to parse logs from various formats (JSON, CSV, plain text), enrich them with metadata, and visualize issues like job failures, latency spikes, or data quality warnings.

In addition to logging, Iâ€™m working on defining metrics that matter for data pipelines, like throughput, error rates, and processing durations. I aim to set up meaningful alerts that help identify problems early and keep data systems reliable and efficient.

Every project in this repo is designed to be modular, repeatable, and easy to adapt for different stack components or cloud platforms. As I progress, Iâ€™m also exploring containerized setups using Docker and thinking about how to scale these tools in production environments.

If you're working with the ELK stack or looking to improve your pipeline observability, feel free to explore, clone, or collaborate. Iâ€™m always open to learning from others in the data and DevOps communities.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and hereâ€™s to building smarter, more transparent data systems, one log at a time.
